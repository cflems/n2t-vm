# n2t-vm
The VM translator from Nand2Tetris, built as a Computer Science class project.

## For inspecting the code:
- VMTranslator is the runner class.
- VMParser is where the meat of the magic happens.
- ArgumentParser is for helping out with command line arguments.
- VMParserException is just a RuntimeException with a message
  attached so the information is actually valuable.
